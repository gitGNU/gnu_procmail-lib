        This is INSTALL file of Procmail Module Library
        <http://www.sourceforge.net/pm-lib>. Procmail is a tool to
        manipulate mail messages. This library includes many ready to use
        plug-in modules to be used from `~/.procmailrc' with INCLUDERC calls,
        like:

            INCLUDERC = /path/to/procmail-lib/module.rc

Preconditions

        You need procmail Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) before files in this
        library are useful; visit <http://www.procmail.org>. The Mail
        Transport Agent (MTA) must have been configured to support
        procmail.

        Activating procmail support depends on operating system and
        selected MTA. Activating procmail for individual accounts may need
        setting up a `~/.forward' file. For more information, refer to
        manual pages procmail(1) and procmailrc(5) or contact local system
        administrator how to activate procmail support.

How to install

        Installation requires GNU make. The default location is
        /usr/local/share/procmail-lib for modules and
        /usr/local/doc/procmail-lib for documentation. To run system wide
        install with different directoy, supply `prefix' and/or `exec_prefix'
        to make(1) call:

            make prefix=/usr/share install

        To install for local account, use:

            make DESTDIR=$HOME prefix=/. man_prefix=/. data_prefix=/. install

How to sart using modules

        Following libraries are included:

        o   Alan Stebben's modules (under directory `lib-stebbens')
        o   Jari Aalto's modules (under directory `lib'; files pm-ja*.rc)

        Refer to README* files for each library to find out what the
        modules can do and how they are called. The whole library is taken
        into use by defining a module directory variable in
        `~/.procmailrc':

            #  PM = Procmail, SRC = source files.
 	    #  The variable name MUST be 'PMSRC'. Other library files
	    #  depend on it.

            PMSRC = /usr/local/share/procmail-lib

        After this variable the modules can be used. Any input parameters
        should be set before calling the modules. Consult included
        documentation or read the comments at the beginning od each module
        file. Here is an example of using Unsolicited Bulk Email aka spam
        module:

            INCLUDERC = $PMSRC/pm-jaube.rc

            #  The "\/" records match to log file (if log has been activated)
            :0:
            * ERROR ?? ^()\/.+
            spam.mbox

Examples

        There are some examples of procmail rc files included under the
        documentation directories. See under `*/examples/' dicrectories.
