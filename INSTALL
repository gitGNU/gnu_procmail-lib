        Procmail is a tool to manipulate mail messages and this
        library includes many plug-in modules ready to be used from
        `~/.procmailrc' with INCLUDERC calls, like:

            INCLUDERC = /path/to/procmail-lib/<module>.rc

Preconditions

        You need Procmail Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) before files in
        this library are useful; visit <http://www.procmail.org>. The
        Mail Transport Agent (MTA) must have been configured to
        support Procmail.

        Activating procmail for individual accounts may need setting
        up a `~/.forward' file. For more information, refer to manual
        pages procmail(1) and procmailrc(5) or contact local system
        administrator how to activate procmail support.

How to install

        Installation requires GNU make. The default location is
        /usr/local/share/procmail-lib for modules and
        /usr/local/doc/procmail-lib for documentation. To run system
        wide install with different directoy, supply `prefix' and/or
        `exec_prefix' to make(1) call:

            make prefix=/usr/share install

        To install for local account, use:

            make DESTDIR=$HOME prefix=/. man_prefix=/. data_prefix=/. install

How to sart using modules

        Refer to README file to find out what the modules can do and
        how they are called. The whole library is taken into use by
        defining a simple directory variable in `~/.procmailrc':

            #  PM = Procmail, SRC = source files.

            PMSRC = /usr/local/share/procmail-lib

        Any input parameters should be set before calling a module.
        Consult included documentation or read the comments at the
        beginning od each module file. Here is an example of using
        Unsolicited Bulk Email, aka spam, module:

            INCLUDERC = $PMSRC/pm-jaube.rc

            #  The "\/" records match to log file (if log has been activated)
            :0:
            * ERROR ?? ^()\/.+
            spam.mbox

Examples

        There are some examples of procmail setup files included under
        the documentation directory `examples/'.
