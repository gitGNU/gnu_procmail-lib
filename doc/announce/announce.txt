New version of Procmail Module Library has been released. During the past
years many new Bayesian programs have appeared to detect Unsolicited Bulk
Email (aka Spam) and procmail can be used to integrate those tools to the
mail handling chain. Overall the changes are focused in Spam and
installation. You may be interested in:

- Pure procmail spam modules: pm-jaube.rc, pm-jaube-keywords.rc

  pm-jaube-prg-runall.rc. This includes support for:

  * annoyance filter
