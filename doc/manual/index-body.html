	    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
	       NOTE    NOTE    NOTE    NOTE    NOTE    NOTE    NOTE

	    This is the default CSS 2.0 generated by the program,
	    please see "t2html --help" for option --script-file
	    to import your own CSS and Java definitions into the page.

	    XHTML note: at page http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#guidelines
	    It is recommended that CSS2 with XHTML use lowercase
	    element and attribute names

	    This default CSS2 has been validated according to
	    http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator-uri.html.en

	    To design colors, visit:
	    http://www.btexact.com/people/rigdence/colours/

	       NOTE    NOTE    NOTE    NOTE    NOTE    NOTE    NOTE
	    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

	    Comments on the CSS tags:

	    -   block-width: "thin" (Netscape ok, MSIE nok)

	    NETSCAPE 4.05

	    -  In general does not render CSS very well. Eg
	       font size changes does not show up in screen.
	    -  :hover property is not recognised

	    NETSCAPE 4.75 as of 2000-10-01

	    -  Shows garbage for stylesheet section that marked CITATION.
	       (IE has no trouble to show it)

	    MSIE 4.0+

	    - Renders CSS very well.

	    Media types

	    - Netscape does not transfer the CSS element definitions to
	      the "print" media as it should. They only affect Browser
	      or media "screen"
	    - That is why you really have to say EM STRONG ... /STRONG EM
	      to get that kind of text seen in printer too. You cannot
	      just define P.column7 { ... }

	    The @media CSS definition is not supported by Netscape 4.05
	    I do not know if MSIE 4.0 supports it.

	    So doing this would cause CSS to be ignored completely
	    (never mind that CSS says the default CSS applies to "visual",
	    which means both print and scree types.)

		@media print, screen {  P.code {..}  }

	    To work around that, we separate the definitions with

		P.code { .. }               // For screen

		@media print { P.code      // for printer
		{
		    ..
		}}

	    And wish that some newer browser will render it right.

        the additional infomation to the RFC comment. Eg. If you read and
        followup to posts in usenet games groups, you could use:

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>
      From: &lt;em&gt;<a href="mailto:login@site.com" >login@site.com</a>&lt;/em&gt; (John Doe+usenet.games)    </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        Or if your email address's localpart (that's characters before @)
        already signify your First and surname, you don't need to repeat it
        in comment. However, place special marker &quot;+&quot; to mark
        additional information part for your procmail recipes:

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>
      From: &lt;em&gt;<a href="mailto:first.surname@site.com" >first.surname@site.com</a>&lt;/em&gt; (+usenet.games)    </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        The use of RFC comment should work everywhere because RFC requires
        that comments are preserved along with the address information.
        If you would have sendmail plus addressing capabilities you would
        have used:

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>
      From: &lt;em&gt;<a href="mailto:login+usenet.games@site.com" >login+usenet.games@site.com</a>&lt;/em&gt; (John Doe)    </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        The idea is that the list infomation is readily available from
        the email. The following recipe will derive the plus information
        and use it directly as a mailbox where to drop the message. If
        The Editor: Emacs, means anything to you, you can program it
        to generate the appropriate From headers automatically when you
        send mail from Gnus Mail/Newsreader MUA. Drop me a message if
        you need an example how a piece of Emacs lisp code makes those
        magic RFC plus addresses in the background while you compose the
        body of the message.

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">

<p class="column8">
        1998-05 David Hunt <em><a href="mailto:dh@west.net" >dh@west.net</A></em> also mentioned that &quot;you need to
        remember that some MTAs, (qmail for one, and soon vmail) use a dash
        ( - ) as the subaddress delimiter. So you'll want to allow for that
        in your code&quot;. For this reason the email part accepts both
        &quot;-&quot; and  &quot;+&quot;. The RFC comment however accepts only &quot;+&quot; and &quot;--&quot;.

        If you receive only small number of messages per day, the performance
        drop of your .procmailrc is not crucial. But if you store many messages
        per day, then the shell calls may be a performance problem.

<p>
<p class="column8">
        This recipe handles generating the cookie to new users, comparing
        the returned cookie against the original one and passing known
        users through if they already had returned their cookie.


<p class="column8">
        When you run automatised scripts, eg. to manage mailing lists
        where users can subscribe and unsubscribe, you have better to
        install safety measure so that someone can not subscribe his enemy
        to 30 mailing lists.


<p class="column8">
        The <em class="word">cookie</em> is any continuous block of random characters that
        is sent to person who wanted to use the service. He must send
        back the <em class="word">cookie</em> before the service starts an action, like
        subscribe. If someone forges the From address to pretend to be
        someone else and then subscribes as-beeing-someone-else to a
        mailing list, the cookie protects this from happening.


<p class="column8">
        The cookie is sent to someone-else, and he must return the cookie
        before the &quot;subscribe&quot; service is activated. Obviously this
        someone-else will not be interested in sending back the cookie and
        thus the forgery fails. Isn't that simple, but efective protection
        against misuse?

      Should I use this as Challenge-Response Spam shield?

  </h2>




<p>
<p class="column8">
        Unsolicited Bulk Email aka Spam is crawling from every possible
        domain thinkable, so you might think that a challenge-response
        policy could be deployed to regular email communication as well.
        The idea would be that unknown people are requested to
        &quot;join&quot; to a white list, before discussion is initiated with them.
        Bulk email shotguns do not reply to challenges (here: cookies),
        so confirmations are not returned. Individual people that want to
        talk, <em class="word">may</em> want to return the cookies.


<p class="column8">
        Sounds like a perfect Unsolicited Bulk Email shield? No more
        non-invited mail? Wrong. Don't use this module for that. The
        whole idea of challenge-response is flawed and causes trouble
        for every person who tries to contact. Imagine for 10 people
        using C-R systems; they would all need to authenticate
        themselves. Who is going to believe that he is not replying to
        a spammer who is collecting email addresses? And what about
        automatic messages that might be received &ndash; there is no
        artificial intelligence to deparate &quot;human&quot; messages from
        automatically generated messages, so challenges just
        increase the overall mail traffic. Every C-R system doubles
        the mail traffic and becomes spam problem by itself.


<p class="column8">
        In short, don't use this module for implementing a C-R system
        to block regular mail to you.

      Description

  </h2>




<p>
<p class="column8">
        When you send a message to a address that had delivery troubles,
        you get a DAEMON message back explaining the error problem. I
        usually want to save these daemon mesaages to a different folder
        and check the folder from time to time. A typical daemon message
        is like this (shortened)

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>
      From: Mail Delivery Subsystem &lt;em&gt;<a href="mailto:MAILER-DAEMON@my.domain.com" >MAILER-DAEMON@my.domain.com</a>&lt;/em&gt;
      Subject: Warning: could not send message for past 4 hours

      The original message was received at...
      ----- Transcript of session follows -----
      Deferred: Connection timed out
      ----- Original message follows -----
      [YOUR MESSAGE AS YOU SENT IT WITH HEADERS]    </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        Well, when I read the subjects, I do not like the standard error
        messages, but I also like to know to which address the delivery
        failed and what was the original subject. This small recipe changes
        the daemon message's Subject to

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>
      Subject BRIEF-ERROR-REASON, SENT-TO-ADDRESS, ORIGINAL-SUBJECT    </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        and from that you can immediately tell if you should be worried Eg.
        if SENT-TO-ADDRESS was your friend's, then you want to take actions
        immediately, but if it were your complaint to UBE message to
        postmaster, you don't want to bother reading that daemon message.

      Description

  </h2>




<p>
<p class="column8">
        This includerc makes it possible to control your message forwarding
        via simple remote email message. Thanks to Era Eriksson and Timothy
        J Luoma who gave the initial idea to this forwarding module in the
        procmail mailing list 1997-10-07.



  <a name="106" id="106"></a>
  <h2>
      Activating the forwarding by hand

  </h2>




<p>
<p class="column8">
        If you want to activate the forwarding from the local site where
        this module is, then you could simply write the forward address
        to the file pointed by <em class="word">JA_FWD_FILE</em> which is <samp class="word">~/.forward-address</samp>
        by default.

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>
      % echo Me@somewhere.com &gt; ~/.forward-address    </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        and when you no longer need forwarding, then remove that file.
        But really, this module is not used for that purpose, because it is
        lot easier to write

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>
      :0
      ! Me@somewhere.com    </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        as a first statement in your .procmailrc when you want to forward
        your mail to another account.



  <a name="107" id="107"></a>
  <h2>
      Activating the forwarding by remote email

  </h2>




<p>
<p class="column8">
        Suppose you're on the road and suddenly realize that you want your
        mail forwarded to the current account, then you send following
        control message

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>
      Subject: forward-on password new-address@bar.com
      To: my-account@bar.com
      From: onTheRoad@some.com    </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        That message is is enough to get the mail forwarded to the address
        new-address@bar.com This script will respond to address From that
        the current forwarding is now pointing to address
        &quot;new-address@bar.com&quot;.

  <h2>
      Deactivating forwarding by remote email

<p>
<p class="column8">
        The message is very similar, but the Subject header says

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>
      Subject: forward-off password    </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        And no other fields are checked. Not even Reply-To. In this case
        the confirmation message is sent directly back to From address.



  <a name="109" id="109"></a>
  <h2>
      Activating forwarding via body message

  </h2>




<p>
<p class="column8">
        If for some reason you have no control over the headers of email,
        eg when you send GSM-Mail message from your phone to your account:

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>
      EMAIL foo@bar.com FORWARD-ON PASSWORD new-address@bar.com    </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        The email message looks like this:

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>
      From: GenEmail &lt;em&gt;<a href="mailto:sms@FooBar.net" >sms@FooBar.net</a>&lt;/em&gt;
      Date: Thu Sep 17, 11:42am +0200
      To:   &quot;'Foo.Bar'&quot; foo@bar.com
      Subject: Message 03384874987

      FORWARD-ON PASSWORD new-address@bar.com    </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        Instead of looking at the <samp class="word">Subject</samp> field, you can get this module
        to look at the first words in the body field. See variable
        <samp class="word">JA_FWD_CONTROL_FIELD</samp> which you want to set to &quot;body&quot;.

<p>
<p class="column8">
        If you only have persistent accounts, then you should set the
        <em class="word">JA_FWD_FROM_MUST_MATCH</em> to match those addresses that you have.
        The following setting says that only control messages sent from
        these addresses are accepted. Nobody else can't change your

    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        Hm, that's not a bullet proof, because someone may in theory forge
        the From address. You probably should also set this variable to
        point to accounts where the mail can be legally forwarded to. Then,
        even if the imposter forges the From address; he can't get the
        email forwarded anywhere else than to the valid locations.

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>

</table>


<p class="column8">
        Consider also setting <em class="word">JA_FWD_PASSWORD_CASE</em> to Procmail flag

<p>
<p class="column8">
        Please realise that when you set the forwarding from a remote site,
        be very carefull when you type in the forward address or your mail
        ends up to somebody else's mailbox. Also I recommend that you keep
        <em class="word">JA_FWD_COPY</em> to <em class="word">yes</em> so that your local account always keep the
        copy of forwarded message.


<p class="column8">
        A step further would conventionally encrypt(1)'ing your forwarded
        messages. This way even your top secret messages would be mostly safe
        even if they end up to someone else's mailbox.

<p>
<p class="column8">
        This subroutine tries to detect and derive the mailing list name as
        it appears in some of the known methods that ezlm, smarlist,
        listserv, majordomo etc. normally use. After this subroutine has
        been applied to message the variable <samp class="word">LIST</samp> contains the mailing
        list name. Subroutine adaptively finds new new mailing lists
        from the messages.


<p class="column8">
        The alternative to subscribing to many mailing lists is to read
        them from web archives. Even better way is to use NNTP server at
        <a href="http://www.gmane.org" >http://www.gmane.org</A> which allows you to post as you would to a
        regular newsgroup. Consider using the NNTP interface and you may
        save you from receiving lot of messages that can already be found
        from Gmane's server.

      Sendmail plus type method for list subscription

  </h2>




<p>
<p class="column8">
        If you can use sendmail type PLUS addressing capabilities, you may
        not be interested in this module, because you have an alternative
        way to handle mailing list messages. The extra information after
        &quot;+&quot; is available to procmail scripts via <samp class="word">$ARG</samp> pseudo variable
        when procmail is the LDA. Let's suppose you want to subscribe to
        procmail mailing list and want to save all messages to folder
        list.procmail, then you'd subscribe with address:

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>
      login+list.procmail@site.com    </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        If your email host doe snot provide the plus addressing then it the
        traditiona approach have been to add a piece of recipe to
        <samp class="word">~/.procmailrc</samp> to catch each list. But that's manual work for
        every list. When you use this subroutine, you no longer need to
        write separate mailing list recipes to your <samp class="word">~/.procmailrc</samp> every
        time you subscribe to a new mailing list. The detection of a new
        list will happen automatically.

        &quot;how it probably looks like it&quot;. This is definitedly categorized as
        mailing list message, because <samp class="word">From</samp> and even <samp class="word">Reply-to</samp> has the same

<p class="column8">
        Bill Houle sent interesting headers which caused to add
        more heuristic than was feasible to solve the list detection.
        From the below headers it is practically impossible to derive the
        original list name. So, the list name is artificially constructed
        by combining Reply-To's LOGIN with Errors-To field's first host

        mailing-list@me.here.at, which will effectively trigger: Ah,
        you have -list in email address, so this message must be from
        mailing list name 'mailing'. Of course it is not and you have to
        disallow the heuristics to make such assumption by defining a
        regexp that rejects a possible choice. For the above example, you
        would define:

<table class="shade-normal">

        carry enough information in headers to determine their list status.
        If you narrow the group by setting JA_LIST_HEADER_REGEXP, then for

<p class="column8">
        First, remember that the variable <samp class="word">JA_LIST_KILL_POSTFIX</samp> is first

        The grabbed LIST name is first, then comes space(s), new name

        convert.

<p class="column8">
        This gives us table below: notice that entries tango-l, w3-beta
        were not included, because the <samp class="word">JA_LIST_KILL_POSTFIX</samp> already got
        rid of the postfixes. Also note how the uppercase match FLAMENCO is
        converted to more suitable lowercase mailbox name. After you have

<p class="column8">
        The list conversion is done with pure procmail means, so it is very
        fast. It also means that the conversion is limited to FROM-STRING
        TO-STRING syntax. No wild cards or regular expressions are allowed.


<p class="column10"><em class="quote10">
          If you consider using an external process, like <samp class="word">sed</samp> or <samp class="word">perl</samp>
          to convert the grabbed list name to something else (when
          <samp class="word">JA_LIST_CONVERSION</samp> method was not enough); think again. For
          each incoming mailing list message you launch external process.
          It is not unusual to receive 700 messages from various mailing
          lists a day, it can be imagined how much load any external
          process would add to the server. Use the grabbed mailing list

<p class="column8">
        If you have many mailing lists that use uppercase names, it may be
        tedious to add each mailing list name to <samp class="word">JA_LIST_CONVERSION</samp>.
        Possible alternative is to use very efficient <samp class="word">tr</samp> program
        to convert characters to lowercase. Again; think twice,
        because any extra process could be avoided if <samp class="word">JA_LIST_CONVERSION</samp>

        This means that the list name grabbed previously changes too.
        This is unfortunate, but it sometimes happens. Let's see an example.

       Now I had two list names that both should be going to the same

<p class="column8">
        The original father of the decoding scheme used here was
        presented by Peter Galbraith <em><a href="mailto:galbraith@mixing.qc.dfo.ca" >galbraith@mixing.qc.dfo.ca</A></em> in
        procmail mailing list somewhere at the end of 1997.


<p class="column8">
        This subroutine supposes that the header has MIME header
        Content-Type: text/plain and performs quoted-printable or
        base64 decoding on the whole message. Note, that if you
        receive messages that have many mime attachments, then this
        recipe is not suitable for it.


<p class="column8">
        Procmail is <em class="word">not</em> designed to handle mime attachments and this
        recipe only applies to whole <strong class="word">body</strong>.


<p class="column8">
        The <samp class="word">pm-jamime-*.rc</samp> is really stretching the limits and any
        serious works hould be delegated to appropriate Perl MIME modules.
        There is a Perl MIME module which will allow you to manipulate MIME
        body parts rather elegantly. See
        <a href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/Eryq/" >http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/Eryq/</A> for MIME-tools.


<p class="column8">
        Se also mimedecode at <a href="ftp://ftp.dde.dk/pub/mimedecode.c" >ftp://ftp.dde.dk/pub/mimedecode.c</A> which
        in included in Debian Linux.

      Notes

<p>
<p class="column8">
        Perl or python is not used, because both are CPU intensive. It
        would be too expansive for accounts or environments receiving
        hundreds of mails
        per day (like from several mailing lists).


<p class="column8">
        RFC 2047 gives possiblity to use MIME iso-8859-1 extensions
        for mail headers.

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>
      Subject: Re: [PIC]: RSA =?iso-8859-1?Q?encryption=B7=B7?=
      Subject: =?iso-8859-1?Q?=5BEE=5D:TV_&amp;_video_IC=B4s_!!?=    </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        There is also base64 possibility (although rare):

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>
      Subject: =?iso-8859-1?B?zvLi5fI6ICAgICAgTVBMQUIzLjQw?=    </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        In worst possible case there is even multiple ISO encoded
        strings in subject. Yes, this is valid, the continued line
        includes spaces at front to keep it with original just like
        in <samp class="word">Received:</samp> headers. This subroutine will not touch headers
        that have multiple ISO tags - procmail is too limited for that.

    <b>      Note:</b>
 If you think this module can do miracles, it cannot.
      MIME messages are very complex in structure and all this module
      can do is to detect <em class="word">simple</em> attachements. It cannot be used
      as - all purpose - all detecting - MIME attachement killer.
      But the part it can do, is done efficiently, because most of the
      things are accomplished using procmail and resource friendly
      <samp class="word">awk</samp>.
    </td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        There are meny programs that add additional information to the
        messages. Microsoft's mail program is one which may include
        a 7k application/ms-tnef attachment to the end of
        message. Many other programs may do the same. This was the idea
        in 1997 when this module was written; to get rid of the extra
        cruft which should not land in the mailbox.


<p class="column8">
        This recipe works like this: If email's structure is

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>
      --boundary
      message-text (maybe quoted-printable)
      --boundary
      some-unwanted-mime-attachment
      --boundary    </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        then the attachment is killed from the body. The message-text part
        is also decoded if it was quoted printable. This leaves clean text
        with no MIME anywhere. MIME headers have will be modified as needed
        due to conversion from multi part and possibly quoted printable to
        plain text and the final  message looks like:

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>
      message    </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        But if email's structure is anything else, like if there were 3
        mime sections:

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>
      --boundary
      message-text (maybe quoted-printable)
      --boundary
      some-attachment
      --boundary
      some-unwanted-mime-attachment
      --boundary    </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        then the &quot;unwanted&quot; part is emptyed by replacing with one empty
        line. The message structure stays the same, but the killed
        &quot;some-unwanted-mime-attachment&quot; part is labelled as text/plain
        so that the MUA (Mail User Agent; the email reader program)
        can decode the MIME message correctly.

            messages by default.
<li><samp class="word">JA_MIME_KILL_RE</samp>, additional <em class="word">REGEXP</em> to kill lines from the

        It may be possible that some messages are malformed and that

        You should know that the variable <samp class="word">JA_MIME_KILL_RE</samp> is used to wipe
        any lines that match that regexp. This is due to MIME structure
        where continuing header lines exist in the body:

        ...Netmind, or The URL-minder is a free, automatic Web-surfing robot
        that keeps track of changes to Web pages that are important to you.
        When the URL-minder detects changes in any of the Web pages you
        have registered, it sends you e-mail. an effective way to test if
        the address is known to Internet. You could use this information to
        see if some automated reply to a address can be sent.



<p class="column8">
        In another words, if you're interested in some URL; say an FAQ page
        and any updates to them, you can tell Netmind to monitor the page
        changes for you and it send a message back every time page changes.


<p class="column8">
        This recipe &quot;pretty formats&quot; the announcement sent by Netmind
        by stripping the message to bare minimum. You usually aren't interested
        in 4k message which includes &quot;Note from our sponsors&quot;, &quot;Try the free
        online demo&quot; etc. The things saved from the announcement message are:

<ul>
	<li>The changed url, which is moved to subject
<li>Cancellation url pointer
	</li>
<li>url to the lists of your monitored urls
	<li>your id number</li>
</ul>

<p class="column8">
        Please let Netmind send you one &quot;pure&quot; message first so that you

        and see how the original message is reduced.

        Ahem, that <samp class="word">pop3</samp> is just to draw your attention. This module has
        nothing to do with pop3. The idea may resemble it though. This
        module listens pop3 requests, and when it gets one, it sends
        the whole mailbox content as separate forwarded messages to the
        account from where you sent the request.


<p class="column8">
        This is kinda &quot;empty my mailbox in account X and send the messages
        to account Y&quot;


<p class="column8">
        You might have permanent forwarding on in account X, but if that
        is your secondary account, you can ask what messages has been arrived
        there with this recipe.


<p class="column8">
        After you have configured your magic pop3 command, which is your
        password, simply send a message to account X, and this module
        initiates emptying the mailbox. Here is an example:

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>
      Subject: pOp3-send [mailbox] [kill]    </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<ul>
	<li><samp class="word">mailbox</samp>, is optional folder name which you want to process.
            it is $DEFAULT if not given in subject. Use <em class="word">absolute</em> path if
            you specify one.
<li>if word <samp class="word">kill</samp> is found, the mailbox will be emptied after
	            forwarding. If the word is not found, messages are preserved.</li>

      Advanced usage

  </h2>




<p>
<p class="column8">
        <span class="word-ref">[conversions]</span>


<p class="column8">
        If some of your files are big, it makes sense to send them in
        compressed base64 format; which in MIME world is called content-type
        gzip. You can set a regexp to enforce encoding for your big
        files before they are sent to user. The following setting will send
        all text files in compressed format to user.

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>
      JA_SRV_XGZIP_REGEXP = &quot;\.txt&quot;    </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        When the message is composed a header is inserted into the message
        telling how the message is to be decoded, in case user doesn't have
        decent MUA that can handle the MIME type:

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>
      X-comment: To decode, cat msg| mmencode -u| gzip -d &gt; test.txt    </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        <span class="word-ref">[noconv and gz]</span>


<p class="column8">
        The <samp class="word">WORD1</samp> parameter after the <samp class="word">FILE</samp> is optional and user can
        override base64 encoding and request plain file if he uses word
        &quot;noconv&quot;.

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>
      Subject: send &lt;FILE&gt; [noconv|gzip]    </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        However, there are files where <samp class="word">noconv</samp> must not be obeyed, like
        the compressed packages that you have put available in .zip, .gz,
        tar.gz or .tgz (GNU tar) format. Following variable controls<br>
        when file is always sent as base64:

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>
      JA_SRV_BASE64_ALWAYS    </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        If the <samp class="word">WORD1</samp> is &quot;gz&quot; or &quot;gzip&quot;, then the gzip is explicitly
        requested, This may be desirable, because some of the text files in
        the server directory may be big and some accounts don't accept big
        messages. A typical bounce looks like:

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>
      552 foo@site.com... Message is too large; 100000 bytes max
      554 foo@site.com Service unavailable    </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        These kind of file server bounce messages are handled in separate
        module which notifies the user that his account didn't accept the
        sent file.


<p class="column8">
        <span class="word-ref">[case sensitivity]</span>


<p class="column8">
        By default the request word (&quot;send&quot;) and ITEM (filename) are not
        case sensitive, unless you set these flags:

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>
      JA_SRV_F_CMD_CASE_SENSITIVE  = &quot;yes&quot;
      JA_SRV_F_FILE_CASE_SENSITIVE = &quot;yes&quot;    </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        If values are &quot;no&quot;, then these are identical commands:

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>
      Subject: Send Help
      Subject  SEND HELP    </pre></td>
    </tr>

  <h2>
      Multi part mime messages

  </h2>




<p>
<p class="column8">
        If you want to deliver big files, you better be sure not to send
        them as a big file. That blocks the connection between every host
        along the path that the big file is transferred. The
        solution is to use MIME multi parts that can be assembled back in
        the receiving MUA. (In case you don't have multi part assembler
        receive Perl script to do it).


<p class="column8">
        MIME multiparts are sent out if

<ul>
	<li>Filename matches JA_SRV_BASE64_ALWAYS, typically tar.gz, zip
<li>Filesize is bigger than JA_SRV_MULTIPART_THRESHOLD, where
	            default chunk size is 100K.</li>
</ul>




<p class="column8">
        When a file meets these criteria, it is read to the <samp class="word">BODY</samp> of message
        and base64 encoded. This all happens in memory, so watch
        procmail logs to see if any problems with very big files. (&gt;30Meg).
        Next, if the base64 conversion succeeded, the composed is handed
        to

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>
      JA_SRV_MIME_MULTI_SEND    </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        Which does the actual delivery and splitting. The default program
        used is <samp class="word">splitmail</samp>. Make sure you have it or substitute the
        program with some equivalent one.

  <h2>
      Using password to validate file requests

  </h2>




<p>
<p class="column8">
        You should be aware that this file server's implementation is public
        in nature. Anyone who asks for a file is allowed to get it. But it
        would be good if you could limit the access to documents with some
        simple way, like if you set up two file servers (see next chapter)
        where one is public and the other is interesting only to group of
        people. You can define a string that must be found in Subject field
        by setting the following variable

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>
      JA_SRV_PASSWORD = &quot;.*&quot;    # default    </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        The default value will match anything in the subject, thus making the
        server public. But if you set it like this

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>
      JA_SRV_PASSWORD &quot;.*123&quot;    </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        Then string &quot;123&quot; must be there somewhere in the line, like here

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>
      Subject: send &lt;FILE&gt; 123    </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        Yes, &quot;123&quot; is actually a CMD definition, but it doesn't matter
        because there is no CMD 123. Subject now matches password and the
        server can be accessed. Of course the following is valid too.

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>
      Subject: send &lt;FILE&gt; noconv 123    </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        If the password was wrong, server won't tell it. The message just
        lands to your mailbox in that case and you can investigate who
        tried to access the restricted server.

<p class="column8">
        because in the previous releases, the MIME type headers were not

        Note, that the file is included &quot;as is&quot; without any extra

        It may look very spartan to print a single line log entry. You see

        instead of multi line announcements makes it possible to write a small
        perl tool to parse information from a single line. If you get many

        Please test the File Server in your environment before you start

        where PATH had /usr/contrib/bin/ where gzip was supposed to be, but
        in spite of my tries procmail didn't find it along the path. Don't
        ask why. I now use absolute binary name:

        There already is a de facto standard where message should contain

        threading by only using Subject and date fields. And grepping same
        subjects is lot easier than from this horrible mess. Note that
        all text is on one line, the subject has been broken only
        for visual reasons:

      Code note

<p>
<p class="column8">
        This subroutine's intention is to make Subject more expressive
        by deleting redundant information. A simplistic approach has
        been taken where Subject consists of list of <em class="word">words</em> whose
        each attribute can be either <samp class="word">ok</samp> or <samp class="word">delete</samp>. No attempt has
        been made to determine the structure of the Subject. You can
        see the algorithm better
        from an example:

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>
      Re: New subject (was Re: Old subject)    </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        That should be treated syntactically like &quot;New subject&quot; and
        forgetting anything between parenthesis. This is however not
        respected and not even tried. The rule applied here is &quot;One
        Re: is tolerated&quot;, so the subject won't change. It doesn't
        matter where &quot;Re:&quot; is.


<p class="column8">
        But here the subject is changed. The rule applied is: Delete
        all unwanted <strong class="word">words</strong> and then add one Re: to the beginning if OLD
        content had any Reply indications

      Description

  </h2>




<p>
<p class="column8">
        Are you sure you want use this word list based checking?


<p class="column8">
        Think twice before you use this subroutine. It knows nothing about
        the content your mail. &quot;It's all UBE unless proven otherwise&quot; is the
        motto. The brutal search tracks words and phrases to find an indication
        of mass posting and traces of Unsolicited Bulk Email (UBE aka spam).
        <strong class="word">Repeat:</strong> Read the first paragraph again before you consider putting
        this file into action. This filter WILL PASS through unwanted mail
        and it WILL catch good mail. This is rule based matching, so I suppose
        you know where you're putting your head with this. Ahem. Alerted? Good.


<p class="column7"><em><strong>
       The Story</strong></em>



<p class="column8">
        There was a man and mail account. The account had limited space,
        couldn't install any other programs because disk quota would have
        exceeded. System administrators weren't' interested in installing
        anything. The Mail server ran behind firewall and had OS that was
        never heard of - it couldn't run other programs. Or if it could,
        the Bad system administrator was too scared to install extra
        programs to the host MTA ran. No joy &ndash; no means to stop incoming
        UBE &ndash; Right?


<p class="column8">
        Wrong. There was procmail. The Bad system adminitrator didn't mention
        that <samp class="word">~/.procmailrc</samp> was honored - just the the external programs
        we a no-no-no (Technical: the MDA host mounted user disks; the
        server ran on separate host and couldn't use any of the user
        compiled programs. Statically linked ones filled up the man's disk
        space).


<p class="column8">
        First line of defense, any defense would do. So, this rule based
        file was born. Nothing else was installed in that account and the
        happy word list based matching routine kept chewing mail, mail,
        mail. And the system administrator was happy - he nurtured the MTA
        host's CPU resources and noticed nothing alarming. All ticked like
        clockwork.


<p class="column8">
        Life began again. After 1000 mail bombards a day, the account was
        usable again.


<p class="column7"><em><strong>
       Motivation</strong></em>



<p class="column8">
        If you can, use the Bayesian filters and forget all rule based
        ones, word and phrase matching based ones; all static filters. On
        the other hand, if you want quick solution, even imperfect, until
        you have time to learn and setup other tools, this subroutine may
        be of interest.


<p class="column8">
        The best part. You can carry this single file anywhere where procmail
        lives. No other files are needed. Setup couldn't be simpler.



  <a name="315" id="315"></a>
  <h2>
      About bouncing message back

  </h2>




<p>
<p class="column8">
        The general consensus is, that you should not send bounces. The UBE
        sender is not there, because the address is usually forged. Do not
        increase the network traffic. Instead save the messages to folders
        and periodically check their contents. It's not nice to be forced to
        apologize about bounces to a wrong destination.



  <a name="316" id="316"></a>
  <h2>
      Code Note

  </h2>




<p>
<p class="column8">
        Procmail is picky about the whitespace in continuing lines, make sure
        there is <strong class="word">not</strong> a single spaces left after the continuation backslash.
        Use good editors or external programs to get rid of the white spaces. In
        Emacs you would add this line to your <samp class="word">~/.emacs</samp> startup file:
        &quot;(add-hook 'write-file-hooks 'delete-trailing-whitespace)&quot;

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">

              |and-more\
              |and-more\
              )
      {
          # Process it
      }    </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        Why are the regexps put into this file and not to a separate regexp
        file? Good question. It is possible to check message's content with
        external process, like <samp class="word">grep</samp>, to see if any matches are found.
        This kind of methodology is covered in Procmail Tips section
        &quot;Using grep with file lists to mach messages&quot; at
        &lt;<a href="http://pm-tips.sf.net" >http://pm-tips.sf.net</A>&gt;. The reason why all the regexp are maintained
        inside this file is:

<ul>
	<li>Simplicity. One file - no extra configuration files or regexp
            databases.
<li>Self standing. Does not call external processes, so it's a little
	            faster than possible <samp class="word">grep</samp> and <samp class="word">fgrep</samp> solution.</li>

        The general consensus is, that you should not send bounces. The UBE

        bouncing messgas &ndash; you just increase mail traffic even more.
        Instead save the messages to folders and periodically periodically

<p class="column8">
        For serious discussion of strenghts of the different programs,
        refer to a very good article &quot;Spam Filters&quot; by Sam Holden at
        2004-08-16 &lt;<a href="http://freshmeat.net/articles/view/964" >http://freshmeat.net/articles/view/964</A>&gt;. The
        article evaluated throughly following programs:

<ul>
	<li>Bayesian Mail Filter        (bayesian)
<li>Bogofilter                  (bayesian)
	</li>
<li>dbacl                       (bayesian; multiple wordlists)
	</li>
<li>Quick Spam Filter           (bayesian)
	</li>
<li>SpamAssassin                (perl matching + bayesian)
	</li>
<li>SpamProbe                   (bayesian)
	<li>SPASTIC                     (procmail recipes)</li>
</ul>




<p class="column8">
        This subroutine implements call interface to <samp class="word">bmf</samp> program. Why
        whould you need it? Because unfortunately <samp class="word">bmf</samp> by default
        use exactly the same headers as spamasassin and the two cannot
        co-operate together: bmf would overwrite existing
        spamassasin headers. This subroutine takes care of saving
        previous headers and move <samp class="word">bmf</samp> results to their own
        <samp class="word">X-Spam-bmf-*</samp> headers.

        There are several Bayesian based statistical analysis programs that
        study the message's tokens and then classify it into two categories:
        good or bad, or if you like, ham and spam. All the Bayesian programs
        are not the same, so if you want to achive magic 99.99% probability
        the only methodology to do that is to chain several programs in

        This procmail subroutine implements call interface to program
        <samp class="word">bsfilter</samp>, which must already have been installed.

<p class="column8">
        Using Spamoracle as sole spam protection is inefficient, because
        version version 1.4 (2004-09-29) does not accept messages from
        stdin. Becaus of this message has to be written to a temporary file
        before calling Spamoracle. Later the temporary file must be removed
        with <samp class="word">rm</samp>. All these three shell calls are needed for each message.
        If you have other detection programs, call them first to identify
        unsolicited Bulk Email.

      Warning

  </h2>




<p>
<p class="column8">
        Put all your UBE (aka spam) filters towards the <strong class="word">end</strong> of your
        ~/.procmailrc. The idea is that valid messages are filed
        first (mailing lists, your work and private mail, bounces) and only
        the uncategorized messages are checked.



  <a name="431" id="431"></a>
  <h2>
      Are you sure you want to use procmail for UBE?

  </h2>




<p>
<p class="column8">
        If you think you can put this recipe as a first line of defence to
        your mail, you will disappoint. Checking UBE with procmail's
        rule based means does not work that way. The good messages
        must be sorted first (like your mailing lists and your
        important work or friend message) and only then what's left to
        process can be scanned by static rule based tools, like this
        procmail module. There are much more better tools that are
        based on statistical analysis of messages. You really should
        consider using one or combination of Bayesian tools:
        <em class="word">Spamassassin</em>, <em class="word">bogofilter</em>, <em class="word">spamprobe</em>, <em class="word">Bayesian</em> <em class="word">Mail</em>
        <em class="word">Filter</em>, <em class="word">ifile</em> etc.


<p class="column8">
        <strong class="word">Repeat:</strong> procmail rules are not the tool to UBE control. The
        pattern matching rules can never keep up with the spammers. That
        said, if you:

<ul>
	<li>Can bare a 70-80 % UBE detection rate.
<li>Can bare 10 % false hits; you need to check you UBE folder
            regularly for messaged that did not belong there.
	</li>
<li>Have an account that does not get large number of UBE messages.
	<li>Or if procmail is all you have in the system.</li>
</ul>




<p class="column8">
        only then consider this module or any other procmail based
        spam filters in that respect. So, please don't set your
        expectations high. Spend good time with the configuration
        variables and check there returned result in variable <samp class="word">ERROR</samp>
        carefully. Good luck.

      Overview of features

  </h2>



<p>
<ul>
	<li>Requires procmail 3.11pre7+
<li>You don't need external files: site block lists, the
            heuristics nail most of the UBE messages. Just plug in this
            module and you have UBE shield active.
	</li>
<li>Header based filtering: Minimum headers, Pegasus bulk mail,
            X-uidl validity check, bogus From-To combination,
	</li>
<li>Address based filtering: Numeric address, Invalid address (eg.
            me@myMarketing.global), UBE-like(friend,remove request.)
	</li>
<li>Text filtering: no html accepted, common advertising slogans,
            unnecessary many capitalized words, HTML message body detection,
	<li>And many more check that just not were listed here.</li>
</ul>




<p class="column8">
        Remember: this is not 100% and there will always be some mishits, so

<p class="column8">
        Originally Daniel Smith posted his spam.rc, where he had gathered
        many tips and heuristics to filter UBE email. This filter here
        expresses work of many procmail users.  Original filters were
        modified, some rules were left out that catched false email
        messages and made the package look a bit more general so that it
        could be included via <samp class="word">INCLUDERC</samp> in the standard way.


<p class="column8">
        Thanks to Daniel and others, the UBE bomb days can be reduced,
        when this filter is active. Some UBE messages may still lurk
        into the mailbox, but that's the problem with all static rule
        based tools.

      About bouncing message back

  </h2>




<p>
<p class="column8">
        The general consensus is, that you should not send bounces. The UBE
        sender is not there, because the address is usually forged. Do not
        increase the network traffic. Instead save the messages to folders
        and periodically check their contents. It's not nice to be forced to
        apologize if you bounced message to a wrong destination. DON'T
        BOUNCE. Forget all recipe examples that use HOST and EXITCODE and
        be a good Net citizen.

<p>
<p class="column8">
        Only handful of the most important variables are described here.
        You really should read all the comments placed in the &quot;user configured
        section&quot; in this procmail module's code. Most of the defaults
        should work out of the box.

<ul>
	<li><samp class="word">JA_UBE_VALID_ADDR</samp>, your email addresses or other
            valid from addresses that will say &quot;this is mail addressed
            directly to you&quot;.
<li><samp class="word">JA_UBE_HDR</samp>, If non-empty, a new header is added which tells which
            recipe was triggered. The header is not added to message, if
            there is nothing to report; i.e. message passed all tests.
	</li>
<li>Various flags: Some of the ube detecting recipes give more
            false hits than nail real ube. Experiment with yourself and turn
            on or off the recipes that work for the kind of ube messages
            you receive.
	</li>
<li><samp class="word">JA_UBE_MAX_BIG_WORDS</samp>, the maximum count of big letter words in the
            message that is tolerated. The current count 5 is rather
            conservative and it is suggested you to increase it to prevent
            trapping too many false hits. Alternatively update JA_UBE_CAPS_OK
            to include accepted words.
	</li>
<li><samp class="word">JA_UBE_APPARENTLY_TO_MAX</samp>, how many Apparently-To headers are
            tolerated. Default is 3.
	</li>
<li><samp class="word">JA_UBE_MAX_HTML_TAGS</samp>, maximum count of html tags allowed in the
            body.
	</li>
<li><samp class="word">JA_UBE_ATTACHMENT_ILLEGAL_KILL</samp>, if set to &quot;yes&quot; (default), then
            illegal attachment from body is ripped off. This is brute way
            to truncate the message abruptly to save mailbox space. You still
            see the headers for tracking, but the body is gone. The regexp
            to test is set in <samp class="word">JA_UBE_ATTACHMENT_ILLEGAL_REGEXP</samp>.
	</li>
<li><samp class="word">JA_UBE_ATTACHMENT_SUSPECT_KILL</samp>, if set to &quot;yes&quot; (default &quot;no&quot;),
            kill suspectible characters in attachement filename. The regexp
            to test is set in <samp class="word">JA_UBE_ATTACHMENT_SUSPECT_NAME_REGEXP</samp>.
	</li>
<li>JA_UBE_CHARSET_LEGAL, if set, accept only these character. The
            default value detect messages with 7bit only (english speaking.
            For foreign language you may want to set this something like
            <samp class="word">$CHAR_7BIT_SET$CHAR_LIST_FINLAD</samp>
	            for Finnish. See <samp class="word">pm-javar.rc</samp> for available character sets.</li>

        Usually known as &quot;vacation&quot; feature. If you cahnge th cache file,
        you can attach this recipe to any messages that you want to deal with
        only once.

      Usage example

  </h2>




<p>
<p class="column8">
        To turn on the vacation feature, create ~/.vac file and recipe below
        activates vacation. If the vacation is not active, then cache file
        is removed. (automatic cleanup). The VERBOSE is also turned off
        when you're on vacation; so that your procmail log will not get
        filled.


<p class="column8">
        So when you go to vacation, you 'touch ~/.vac' and update
        ~/vacation.msg. When you come back, you 'rm ~/.vac'. That's it.


<p class="column8">
        IMPORTANT: If you are subscribed to mailing lists, be sure to file
        messages from those services first and put the vacation recipe
        only after the list or bot messages. Also add sufficent &quot;!&quot; conditions
        in order not to reply to other &quot;bot&quot; service messages.

      Description

  </h2>




<p>
<p class="column8">
        This file defines common variables that you can use in the recipe's
        condition line. Procmail does not know about escape sequences
        like <samp class="word">\t</samp> or <samp class="word">\n</samp> and it is therefore much more readable to use
        variables as substitute for common regular expression
        atoms. Pay attention that the line starts with &quot;*$ &quot;, where
        &quot;$&quot; expands the variables: In this file, the variable names
        represent the well known Perl regular expression names, so
        that $s is alost like Perl expression \s (whitespace) and $S
        is almost equivalent to <samp class="word">\S</samp> (non-whitespace). Similarly, $d is
        <samp class="word">\d</samp> (digit) and $D resembled <samp class="word">\D</samp> (non-digit).

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>
      :0
      *$ $s+something+$s+$d+$a+    </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        The equivalent without variables (you don't see the tabs and
        spaces here):

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>
      :0
      #  Space + tab
      * [         ]something[     ][0-9]+[a-z]+    </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        In addition all system dependent variables are defined in this module.
        For example if you have Gnu awk, it is strongly suggest that you set:

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>
      AWK = &quot;/path/to/gawk&quot;  # in Linux, this would be /usr/bin/awk    </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        You can define these variables before or after the module, just make
        sure the binaries reflect your operating system's paths. In general,
        if you &quot;port&quot; your setup to several system, dont' include absolute
        paths. In the other hand, if your setup is in the same place using
        absolute paths will speed up executions by a factor of 3 or more.
        (depending on how long your PATH is)

      Special variable JA_FROM_DAEMON

  </h2>




<p>
<p class="column8">
        In order to boost procmail and to save extra CPU cycles, this module
        defines variable <samp class="word">JA_FROM_DAEMON</samp> that caches the information of
        ^FROM_DAEMON. You can refer to <samp class="word">JA_FROM_DAEMON</samp> as you would to
        big brother FROM_DAEMON. This has the advantage that procmail
        has already computed the result and the variable <samp class="word">JA_FROM_DAEMON</samp>
        is used as a cache, thus avoiding repeated FROM_DAEMON regexp
        tests, which are expensive. Variable <samp class="word">JA_FROM_DAEMON_match</samp>
        contains &quot;&quot; or the result of matched daemon text.

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>
      *$ $JA_FROM_DAEMON    </pre></td>

  <h2>
      Usage example

  </h2>




<p>
<p class="column8">
        For your .procmailrc, you can simply put this, because you
        want to load the variables at startup

<p>
<table class="shade-normal">
    <tr>
    <td class="shade-normal-attrib" valign="top">
    <pre>

      INCLUDERC = $PMSRC/pm-javar.rc    </pre></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p class="column8">
        If you're developing your own modules that use these variables
        put these lines at the beginning. <samp class="word">~/.procmailrc</samp>. It checks
        if WSPC variable does not include a space --&gt; load the
        variable definitions. If the variable is already defined, the
        file is not loaded. The test line is something alike #ifdef &ndash;
        #endif in C/C++ language or a conditional &quot;import&quot; command in
        other languages.

<table class="shade-normal">
