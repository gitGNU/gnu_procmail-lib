lib-stebbens/README.txt

        Alan Stebbens has used procmail for a very long time and these
        files in this directory were imported to the Sourceforge's
        procmail library project (pm-lib). Hopefully getting the best
        out of procmail is now easier when you have Alan's libraries
        also in the project.

        The original libraries were available (2002-01-02) from Alan's
        file server (there was no other download method known). The
	original request used was:

               Subject: send procmail lib
                    To: Alan K. Stebbens <alan.stebbens@openwave.com>

        If you have any questions concerning about programs or code in
        this directory, please contact Alan.
