This is the README file for Alan Stebbens' procmail library.

See below for some information on procmail itself.


Here is a quick synopsis of the files:

Makefile	a Unix Makefile to help install these libary
		files in /usr/local, or another location.

README		This file.

ackmail.rc	a set of recipes which perfom auto-acknowledgement
		of incoming mail.  This file uses guess-mua.rc and
		unread-mh.rc.  See ackmail.3 for details.

commands.help	A file of information sent in response to a mail
		request of "Subject: help info".  See "commands.rc".
		
commands.rc	A set of recipes which recognize commands in the
		Subject: header and perform them.  A log is kept
		of all such commands.

comm-reply-file.rc
		A recipe file which replaces the body of the 
		current message with a named, or generates an 
		error report.  A "subroutine" recipe file for
		"commands.rc".

correct-addr.rc	A recipe file which can help do mail forwarding
		for users who have moved or changed email 
		addresses.  *** CURRENTLY NOT WELL TESTED ***

date.rc		A recipe file to extract date and time information
		from the DATE variable, or from the current
		mail buffer if DATE is not defined.

dupcheck.rc	A recipe file which removes duplicate mail.

get-date.rc	A recipe file which uses date.rc to extract date
		and time information from date fields of the current 
		message.

get-from.rc	A recipe file which extracts the "best" address,
		including personal information from the various
		originating address fields.

guess-mua.rc	A recipe file which attempts to guess the current
		MUA (Mail User Agent).  Not needed of MUA is 
		explicitly defined.

headers.rc	Defines some variables which can be used for matching
		against headers.
		
list-addr.rc	A recipe file which trys to determine if the current
		mail is from a mailing list or not.  This is still
		*experimental* and *** NOT WELL TESTED ***.

pf-check.rc	A recipe to check if the message is from a given
		ADDR, or if it is from the user and to the ADDR, then
		to add DEST to the pending folder list, PF_DEST.

pf-chkto.rc	A recipe to check of the message is to an ADDR, and to
		add DEST to the pending folder list, PF_DEST.

pf-save.rc	After all address checks have been done, via either 
		pf-check.rc or pf-chkto.rc, then perform the filing
		into folders named by PF_DEST.  The folders can
		either be MH-style or folder-file style (but not both).

proclint	A Perl script which attempts to parse and pick "lints"
		from procmail scripts.

procmail-lib.html
		An HTML file which describes the Procmail Library.

unread-mh.rc	A recipe file which attempts to compute how many unread
		messages there are for an MH user.
