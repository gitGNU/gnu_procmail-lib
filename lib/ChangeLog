	(JA_UBE_KEYWORD_HEADER): Recipe moved inside another recipe so
	that the processing is more logical

	is sum of all found reasons separated by colon (:). This means
	that error string may be like: "Header-SubjectKeywords:Body-Keywords"

2006-09-13  Jari Aalto  <jari dot aalto A T cante dot net>

        * pm-jamime-save.rc
        - All temp variables (but dummy) now have prefix JaMimeSave to prevent
          clashes to user variables.
        (AWK): Wrong test: COUNT => MIME_BOUNDARY_COUNT in recipe.
        BEGIN-clause error in awk. Corrected \e => 'e'. The 'extrtacted
        to file ...' message was missing preceding newline in the replaced
        message (stuck against MIME headers which was wrong).
        (JA_MIME_SAVE_OVERWRITE ?? no): Change the filename from
        FILE.ext.YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD-hhmm.file.ext which preserves
        the file extension better. Added the Hour and minute to make
        the filename more unique.
        (file ?? a-z): Check for existing LINEBUF
        setting. IF bigger than 500K+ (the default), then use what
        user has set. Bug: code overrode e.g value 9999999
        with 500K+. Closes sourceforge bug
