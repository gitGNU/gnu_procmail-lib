#
#   Description
#
#       Framework for all programs that need to reply to messages only once.
#       Usually known as "vacation" feature. If you cahnge th cache file,
#       you can attach this recipe to any messages that you want to deal with
#       only once.
#
#   Required settings
#
#	PMSRC must point to source directory of procmail code. This subroutine
#       will include
#
#       o   pm-javar.rc
#
#   Call arguments (variables to set before calling)
#
#       o   JA_VAC, To activate vacation, set value to "yes"
#       o   JA_VAC_RC, When new message-id is found, run this includerc
#       o   JA_VAC_ID_CACHE, Remember to clear this file when you start
#           the vacation.
#
#   Usage example
#
#	To turn on the vacation feature, create ~/.vac file and recipe below
#	activates vacation. If the vacation is not active, then cache file
#	is removed. (automatic cleanup). The VERBOSE is also turned off
#	when you're on vacation; so that your procmail log will not get
#	filled.
#
#       So when you go to vacation, you 'touch ~/.vac' and update
#       ~/vacation.msg. When you come back, you 'rm ~/.vac'. That's it.
#
#       IMPORTANT: If you are subscribed to mailing lists, be sure to file
#       messages from those services first and put the vacation recipe
#       only after the list or bot messages. Also add sufficent "!" conditions
#       in order not to reply to other "bot" service messages.
#
#           JA_VAC_ID_CACHE = $HOME/.pm-vac.cache

#           {
#               VERBOSE     = off
#               JA_VAC      = "yes"
#               JA_VAC_RC   = $PMSRC/pm-myvac.rc	# my vacation recipe
#               INCLUDERC   = $PMSRC/pm-javac.rc	# framework
